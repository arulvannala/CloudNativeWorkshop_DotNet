= Lab 5 - Running, Publishing and Deploying ASP.NET Core Micro-services

[abstract]
--
In this lab we will become comfortable with running ASP.NET Core Web applications locally on our PC and publishing and deploying them to Cloud Foundry.

We will be using a ``Fortune Teller`` micro-services based application as our sample.
The app consists of a ``Fortune Teller Service`` which provides a REST API to serve up Fortunes and a ``Fortune Teller UI`` that can be used to display the Fortunes.
In its current state, this app is not fully functional.
The ``Fortune Teller Service`` only serves up a single Fortune and the ``Fortune Teller UI`` doesn't know how to communicate with the ``Fortune Teller Service`` so it always returns a single ``Hello world`` Fortune.

In this lab we will work with both of them, running them and pushing them to Cloud Foundry in their current state.
In future labs we will systematically make the changes necessary to make them a working application.

== Open Visual Studio Solution
. Start VS2015 and open the solution _Workshop/Session-02/Lab05.sln_
.. Open _Fortune-Teller-Service/project.json_ or  _Fortune-Teller-UI/project.json_.
... Notice the ``frameworks`` section specifies ``netcoreapp1.1`` and ``net452``. This ASP.NET Core app is intended to run on ``.NET Core 1.1`` and ``.NET Framework 4.5.2``.
... Notice the ``dependencies`` section specifies all the NuGets the application depends on.
... Notice the ``dependencies`` section under ``netcoreapp1.1``. With .NET core you have to specify all of the dependencies, nothing is included by default. With ``net452`` you get the normal ``mscorlib`` classes by default.
... Notice ``Microsoft.NETCore.App`` has ``type`` commented out. When targeting .NET Core, this causes the app to be fully self-contained when we publish it. Otherwise we get a `portable` app.
... Notice the ``runtimes`` section specifies lots of operating systems, including ``Windows`` and ``Ubuntu``. This is a X-Plat app and these are the runtimes it can operate on.
.. Open Visual Studio Debug Launch dropdown.
... Notice ``Framework`` selection allows either ``netcoreapp1.1`` or ``net452`` to be selected.
... Notice hosting environment can be ``IIS Express`` or ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` and either can be selected.

== Run Fortune Teller Service in VS2015, on .NET 4.x

. Start Visual Studio 2015 and open the solution _Workshop/Session-02/Lab05.sln_
.. Set ``Fortune-Teller-Service`` as active project (i.e. Select Project->Right Click->Set As Startup project)
.. Select  ``Framework`` to be ``.NET 4.5.2``
... Right click on a project
... Select Publish, follow the wizard and make sure you select the ``.NET 4.5.2`` Target Framework and Target Runtime
.. Select a ``Hosting environment`` to be ``Fortune_Teller_Service``
.. Start application (e.g. CTRL-F5 or F5)
.. Notice command window opens with app running
.. Open browser and hit REST endpoint ``http://localhost:5000/api/fortunes/all``.
.. Try setting breakpoints in the FortunesController if you're running in the debugger.
.. How does port 5000 get selected to be used on startup? Look at ``launchSettings.json``.
.. Stop the app, and change it to run under IIS Express.
.. Notice no command window opens with app running.
.. Use browser to hit the REST endpoint.
